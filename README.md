# BillsBlog

This is a basic blog I created with Django for a programming class in Fall of 2018. It can be viewed at http://billsblogg.herokuapp.com/.

Note: The 'Share Post' feature only works with certain email domains.

## Add Blog Posts with Selenium

The blogTestCSV.py pulls posts from blogPosts.csv and uses Selenium to add them to the blog via the admin site.

Note: This can only be done if you have the correct password to the admin account (The real password has been replaced with a fake one for security purposes).
